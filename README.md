# Installation

To install the pypi package, run:

```bash
pip install math_without_integers
```

**Note**: Most linux distros prohibit global pip installations. You have to figure it yourself how you can install them. 

To use it in your python program (why?), add:

```python
from math_without_integers import zero_to_nine
from math_without_integers import zero_to_infinity
```

at the top of your python code.
